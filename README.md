# brightness-fn7
The script allows you to increase/decrease the brightness. If `brightness != maxLevel`, then set maxLevel, otherwise - `minLevel`. The script was created in connection with the removal of this function from KDE

**Warning:** brightness changes occur only at the software level, the multiplication of the brightness by gamma rgb occurs

# Usage
1. `chmod +x script.sh`
2. Bind it with the key combination you need

# Arguments
`./script.sh <min level> <max level>`

By default, min level is 0.075, max level is 1.0
